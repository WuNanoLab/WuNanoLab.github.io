Our new paper with collaborating labs is published in Micromachines, titled "[Kinetic and Parametric Analysis of the Separation of Ultra-Small, Aqueous Superparamagnetic Iron Oxide Nanoparticle Suspensions under Quadrupole Magnetic Fields](https://www.mdpi.com/2072-666X/14/11/2107)"

In this work, we are investigating how to use a quadrupole magnetic sorter (QMS) to separate tiny 20 nm and 30 nm superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) in water at even low concentrations (as low as 0.5 g/L). By carefully keeping an eye on the SPION concentrations inside the QMS container, we are figuring out how different factors affect the separation process and studying how it all unfolds. The results give us valuable insights into the complex dynamics and the delicate balance of factors that make the quick separation of SPIONs possible using affordable permanent magnets.
