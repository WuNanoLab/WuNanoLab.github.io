The 2023 Fall [BioMed Journal Club](https://www.wunanolab.com/services-6) is a weekly event hosted by the TTU ECE Department every Wednesday from August 30th to November 29th, 2023. This semester's journal club has 9 participating faculty members and 11 PhD student presenters. The main objective of the club is to encourage PhD students to read research papers, improve their academic presentation skills, and broaden their horizons on biosensors, biomedical equipment, and related technologies. Additionally, the club provides an opportunity for faculty members to find potential collaborations and new research ideas.

  

Looking forward to the 2024 Spring BioMed Journal Club!
