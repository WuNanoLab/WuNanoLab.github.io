Our latest study, titled "[Effects of Excitation Field Amplitude on Magnetic Particle Imaging Performance: A Modeling Study](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6463/adeea2)," has been published in the Journal of Physics D: Applied Physics.

  

This work addresses a key knowledge gap in how the relaxation dynamics of magnetic nanoparticle (MNP) tracers influence the signal quality of magnetic particle imaging (MPI), including signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and spatial resolution. Using a stochastic Langevin model that accounts for both Brownian and NÃ©el relaxation mechanisms, we simulated the magnetic responses of various MNP tracers under varying excitation field amplitudes. Imaging resolution and signal quality were quantified using Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM) of the point spread function and SNR at the third harmonic, respectively. Our findings not only support prior observations on the impact of excitation amplitude in MPI performance but also offer new insights into the interplay between nonequilibrium relaxation dynamics, tracer core size, and imaging fidelity.
