We are pleased to announce that our latest paper, “[Computational Predictions on the Magnetic Particle Imaging Performance of Tracers Subjected to Magnetic Dipole-Dipole Interactions](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10870345),” has been published in IEEE Transactions on Magnetics.

  

Magnetic dipole-dipole interactions (dipolar interactions) among magnetized tracers are often overlooked in applications such as magnetic sensing, imaging, and separation. In this study, we investigated how these interactions influence the performance of superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticle (SPION) tracers in magnetic particle imaging (MPI). Using the stochastic Langevin function, we modeled an ensemble of 1,000 SPION tracers within a field-free region (FFR) to analyze key magnetization dynamics. Our study examined time-domain magnetization responses, magnetization-field (M-H) curves, voltage signals detected by receiver coils, higher harmonics, and point spread functions (PSFs). Higher harmonics and the Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM) of the PSFs were used as key indicators to assess the impact of dipolar interactions on MPI performance.

  

This work provides valuable insights into the role of dipolar interactions in MPI tracer behavior, offering new perspectives for optimizing tracer design and improving imaging resolution.
