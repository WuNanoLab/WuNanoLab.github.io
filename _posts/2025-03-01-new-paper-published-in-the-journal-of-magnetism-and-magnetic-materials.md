Our collaborative work titled "[Trajectory Analysis of Single Magnetic Bead Under Elliptical Cylindrical Magnet and Rotating Field](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304885325001659)" is publisehd in the Journal of Magnetism and Magnetic Materials.

  

In this work, we propose a Lagrangian-Eulerian model to predict the trajectory of magnetic beads under the influence of an elliptical cylindrical magnet and a rotating magnetic field. By incorporating the coupling between magnetic beads and the surrounding fluid, this approach minimizes the impact of mesh size on accuracy while significantly improving computational efficiency. Our findings provide a robust theoretical foundation for optimizing magnetophoretic circuit designs and enhancing precise control over the movement of single magnetic beads and bead-labeled cells.
