Congratulations to our collaborator, Dr. Jenifer Gomez Pastora, who has been awarded a $587,878 grant from the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) of the National Institutes of Health, under Award Number R15HL181720.

  

This 3-year project, ‚ÄúFractionation of RBCs via Label-Free Magnetophoresis Using Novel Additive Manufactured Devices,‚Äù is led by Dr. Gomez Pastora, with co-investigators Drs. Glenn Zeng, James Yang, and Kai Wu. The team aims to harness magnetic fields to separate red blood cells in a faster, more cost-effective, and highly accurate manner. Unlike conventional approaches, magnetic fractionation distinguishes cells based on their hemoglobin and iron content, opening new possibilities for clinical diagnostics, blood banking, and transfusion medicine.
