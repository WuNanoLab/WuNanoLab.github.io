Our recent work titled "[Characterizing the Physicochemical Properties of Magnetic Nanoparticles by A Surface Plasmon Resonance Approach](https://pubs.aip.org/aip/adv/article/15/3/035022/3339540/Characterizing-the-physicochemical-properties-of)" is published in AIP Advances.

  

This work reports a surface plasmon resonance (SPR) approach to characterize the physicochemical properties of magnetic nanoparticles!

  

Using a Kretschmann configuration-based SPR platform with a scanning angular range of up to 17Â°, we investigated resonance conditions across various magnetic nanoparticle suspensions. By analyzing SPR resonance angle shifts, we successfully differentiated nanoparticles based on surface coatings, magnetic core sizes, and concentrations.

These findings highlight the strong potential of SPR sensors for nanoparticle characterization, offering a precise and label-free method for future research and applications in nanotechnology and biomedicine.
