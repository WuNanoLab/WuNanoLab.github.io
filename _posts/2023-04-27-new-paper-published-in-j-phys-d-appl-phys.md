Our new paper titled "[A method for multiplexed and volumetric-based magnetic particle spectroscopy bioassay: mathematical study](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6463/acd0bd)" is published in J. Phys. D: Appl. Phys.

This work involves a systematic study of the magnetization curves (M-H curves) of various types of MNPs, and their relationship to the dynamic magnetic responses when exposed to AC magnetic driving fields. Due to the distinct structures, sizes, and magnetic properties of each type of MNP, the resulting harmonics are also unique. This study provides a potential solution for the simultaneous detection of multiple analytes in a single run, namley, the multiplexed MPS-based bioassay.
