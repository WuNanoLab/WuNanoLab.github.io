Our new paper with collaborating labs is published in Processes, titled "[SPIONs Magnetophoresis and Separation via Permanent Magnets: Biomedical and Environmental Applications](https://www.mdpi.com/2227-9717/11/12/3316)".

  

This review provides an in-depth exploration of magnetic field gradient separation techniques, alongside a comprehensive discussion of the applications of superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles in the context of drug delivery, cell separation, and environmental remediation.
