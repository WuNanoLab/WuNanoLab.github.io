The book "[Magnetic Nanoparticles in Nanomedicine](https://shop.elsevier.com/books/magnetic-nanoparticles-in-nanomedicine/wu/978-0-443-21668-8)," co-edited by Dr. Kai Wu and Dr. Jian-Ping Wang, is now available! This 542-page book, published by Elsevier, features contributions from experts in industry and academia.

  

This book is divided into five sections. The first section covers the material properties, synthesis, modification, and characterization techniques of magnetic nanoparticles. The second section explores the medical applications of magnetic nanoparticles, including magnetic hyperthermia, drug/gene delivery, and neural stimulation. The third section introduces in vitro disease diagnosis, particularly focusing on emerging magnetic biosensors in recent years. The fourth section focuses on in vivo disease diagnostic imaging technologies, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic particle imaging (MPI). The fifth section discusses the biocompatibility of magnetic nanoparticles, considering aspects such as immunotoxicity and cellular uptake.
