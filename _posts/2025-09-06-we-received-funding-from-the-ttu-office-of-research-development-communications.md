Our project titled “SMART-MNPs: Smart Magnetic Nanoparticles for MRI-guided and Adaptive Cancer Therapy” has been selected as an awardee for the Research Assistance Program, FY26, by the TTU Office of Research Development & Communications.

  

This 1-year project will provide us with $4,000 to purchase lab supplies and cover facility usage fees.

  

Cancer remains one of the leading causes of death worldwide, and current treatments often harm healthy tissues due to limited precision. Magnetic hyperthermia—using magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) to generate heat and selectively kill tumor cells—offers a promising alternative but faces challenges with heating control, safety, and realistic tumor models. Our project will develop next-generation iron oxide MNPs with engineered dopants and shapes to enhance both heating and MRI imaging. These particles will be tested in 3D tumor-like models to better mimic clinical conditions, laying the groundwork for safer and more precise cancer therapies.
