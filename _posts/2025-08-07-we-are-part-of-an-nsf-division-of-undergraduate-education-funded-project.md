Congratulations to lead PIs Drs. Tim Dallas, Hamed Sari-Sarraf, and Heather Greenhalgh-Spencer, who were recently awarded a $2,000,000 grant from the NSF Division of Undergraduate Education (DUE) under award [#2424402](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2424402).

  

The project, ‚ÄúDeveloping the Semiconductor Industry Workforce in Texas,‚Äù addresses the national demand for highly trained scientists, engineers, mathematicians, and technicians by supporting the retention and graduation of high-achieving, low-income students with demonstrated financial need at Texas Tech University.

  

Through this program, at least 36 scholars pursuing BS degrees in electrical engineering and computer engineering will receive scholarships of up to $15,000 per year for three years. In addition to financial support, scholars will benefit from:

*   Faculty and semiconductor industry mentorship
    
*   Hands-on semiconductor manufacturing experiences
    
*   Cohort-based experiential learning opportunities
    
*   Personalized, AI-informed career preparation
    
*   Laboratory training and academic/professional mentoring
    

  

The co-investigators are Drs. Jessica Gottlieb, Ayrton Bernussi, Hieu Nguyen, Rui He, Brian Nutter, and Kai Wu.
