Our latest collaborative work, titled “[Multiplexed Detection in Magnetic Particle Spectroscopy: A Systematic Parameter Analysis](https://journals.aps.org/prapplied/abstract/10.1103/22cn-nw8t),” has been published in _Physical Review Applied_.

  

This study addresses a key challenge in magnetic particle spectroscopy (MPS) and magnetic particle imaging (MPI): achieving reliable multiplexing for assays and imaging. We present a colorization algorithm based on the principle that the harmonic signal of a nanoparticle mixture can be modeled as the weighted sum of the harmonics of individual magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs), proportional to their respective quantities. Using a truncated harmonic model, we successfully decoded the composition of quaternary mixtures of iron oxide MNPs. The experimental results demonstrated multiplexed detection with an average error of 2.35%. This high-accuracy approach offers a promising solution for multiplexed MPS bioassays and multi-tracer MPI imaging.
