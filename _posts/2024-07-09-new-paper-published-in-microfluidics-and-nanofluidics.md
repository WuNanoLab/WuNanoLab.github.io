Our latest research in collaboration with leading labs from XJTU is published in Microfluidics and Nanofluidics, titled "[Investigation on the Focusing and Separation of Polystyrene Microbeads in An Integrated Microfluidic System Using Magnetized Functionalized Flexible Micro-magnet Arrays](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10404-024-02749-5)".

  

This work introduces on-chip focusing and separation of polystyrene microbeads. Unlike traditional bulky magnets, our NdFeB powder-based micro-magnets create flexible and optimized magnetic fields. We've thoroughly investigated the focusing and separation of microbeads in our microfluidic system, both numerically and experimentally. This advancement is a significant step forward for applications like single-cell analysis and disease diagnosis.
