Our new paper titled "[Five-Minute Magnetic Nanoparticle Spectroscopy-Based Bioassay for Ultrafast Detection of SARS-CoV-2 Spike Protein](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acsanm.2c05237)" is published in the ACS Applied Nano Materials. This paper reported a 5-min magnetic particle spectroscopy (MPS)-based bioassay strategy, which may be applied to reduce the assay time for other liquid-phase, volumetric biosensors such as NMR, quantum dots, fluorescent biosensors, etc.
