Our new paper titled "[Metamaterial As Perfect Absorber for High Sensitivity Refractive Index Based Biosensing Applications at Infrared Frequencies](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6463/aceb6f)"is published in the Journal of Physics D: Applied Physics.

  

In this paper, we present a novel metamaterial unit cell absorber design based on a metal/insulator/metal sandwich structure. Our approach undergoes rigorous finite element method (FEM) computational analysis to ensure precise and reliable outcomes. The proposed metamaterial sandwich structure showcases outstanding absorption performance, achieving an almost perfect absorption rate of 99.996% at the resonance infrared frequency of 39.8 THz.

  

To demonstrate the versatility of our metamaterial unit cell, we incorporate a sensing medium setup in our model, showcasing its remarkable sensitivity in detecting subtle changes in the refractive index. We achieve a frequency shift sensitivity of 3.74 THz/RIU, accompanied by a quality factor (Q-factor) of 10.33, across a wide range of refractive indices (1.0 - 2.0). For cancer detection, our approach achieves a sensitivity of 3.5 THz/RIU. These findings highlight the exceptional performance of our method in accurately detecting changes in refractive index, making it highly promising for various sensing applications.
