Our new paper titled "[Ultra-Flexible Giant Magnetoresistance Biosensors for Lab-on-A-Needle Biosensing](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/admi.202201417)" is published in Advanced Materials Interfaces.

In this paper, flexible GMR biosensor arrays were fabricated with a two-step backside thinning approach. A lab-on-a-needle sensing platform was developed by attaching the ultra-flexible GMR sensors to the tip of a glass needle with a radius of 1 mm. Despite the tight bending curvature, the detection of OSCA-8 cells was performed successfully.
