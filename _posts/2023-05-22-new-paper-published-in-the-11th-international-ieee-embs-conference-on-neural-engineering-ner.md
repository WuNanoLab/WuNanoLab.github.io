Our new paper titled "[Impact of microcoil shape and the efficacy of soft magnetic material cores in focal micromagnetic neurostimulation](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10123859)" is published in the 2023 11th International IEEE/EMBS Conference on Neural Engineering (NER).

In this paper, we have studied 3 shapes of Î¼coils with comparable sizes in terms of spatial contour plots of magnetic field and induced electric field. Furthermore, the efficacy of 2 shapes of soft magnetic material (SMM) cores, cone and rod, of varying sizes have been studied to obtain a spatially focal magnetic field and increased magnitude of induced electric field.
