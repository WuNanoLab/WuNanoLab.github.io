We are excited to share our latest collaborative review article, “[Magnetic-Assisted Manipulation of Rare Blood Cells for Diagnosis: A Systematic Review](https://analyticalsciencejournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/bit.70010),” now published in Biotechnology and Bioengineering. This work was conducted in partnership with Drs. Jeffrey Chalmers and Jenifer Gomez‐Pastora’s labs.

  

The review explores recent advances in magnetic separation technologies for isolating rare cells from blood—such as circulating tumor cells (CTCs), fetal cells, and diseased red blood cells (RBCs)—which are vital for diagnostic and therapeutic applications. We examine both label-based methods using immunomagnetic nanoparticles and label-free approaches that exploit intrinsic magnetic properties. These techniques offer significant advantages in speed, selectivity, and cost compared to traditional cell sorting methods, with reported efficiencies reaching up to 99%.

  

The review also highlights current challenges—such as improving cell purity, scalability, and viability after separation—and points to emerging opportunities, including the use of magnetic levitation, stronger nanoparticles, and machine learning for smarter sorting. We hope this work helps guide future innovations toward clinically viable magnetic-based diagnostics.
