Our new paper titled "[Magnetic Nanoparticles: A Review on Synthesis, Characterization, Functionalization, and Biomedical Applications](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smll.202304848)" is published in Small.

  

This review outlines diverse magnetic nanoparticle (MNP) designs, materials, morphologies, and characterization methods. It assesses various MNP synthesis techniques, their pros and cons, and explores inorganic and organic surface coatings. Biomedical MNP applications are covered, spanning hyperthermia, MRI, drug delivery, biosensors, and magnetic particle imaging. Future MNP structure trends and novel biomedical prospects are also discussed.
