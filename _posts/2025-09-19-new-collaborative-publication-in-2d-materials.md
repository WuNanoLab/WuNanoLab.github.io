The collaborative paper led by Drs. Rui He and Wencan Jin, titled "[Dilute magnetic impurity-induced effective phonon magnetic moment in Fe-doped monolayer MoS2](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/2053-1583/ae04fc/meta)" is now published in 2D Materials!

  

This work shows that substituting Fe atoms into monolayer MoS2 enables control of phonon magnetism in 2D semiconductors. Magneto-Raman spectroscopy studies reveal a new orbital–phonon hybrid mode with a large magnetic moment (2.8 μB), while local Fe moments reshape spin fluctuations without long-range order. This highlights substitutional doping as a powerful strategy to engineer magnetic properties in 2D materials.
