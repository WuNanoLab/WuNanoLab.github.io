Prof. Wu delivered an invited talk titled "Magnetic Biosensors for Point-of-Care (POC) Diagnostics" for the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at University of Minnesota, on September 16, 2022.

Below is the abstract of this talk:

The past decade has seen the continuous advancement of disease diagnostic platforms in a wide variety of research areas such as magnetic, optical, mechanical, and electrochemical sensing systems. However, there is an increasing demand for more accessible routine diagnostics for patients with respect to high accuracy, ease of use, and low cost. Magnetic biosensors have received extensive attention as promising candidates for next-generation disease diagnostic platforms. This approach is based on magnetic labels, rather than classical fluorescent labels, combined with magnetic sensors to detect stray fields from magnetic nanoparticle (MNP) labels. Since biological tissues and fluids are nonmagnetic or diamagnetic, there is negligible background noise from the complex biological samples, thus, it greatly benefits the higher signal-to-noise ratio of magnetic biosensors. In this talk, Dr. Wu will introduce the magnetic particle spectroscopy (MPS)-based biosensor. The working principles, the transition from lab-based assays to POC devices, and applications in disease diagnosis will be presented.
