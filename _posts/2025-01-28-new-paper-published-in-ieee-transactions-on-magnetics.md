Our latest work titled "[Investigation on the Magnetic Hyperthermia Performance of Commercial Iron Oxide Magnetic Nanoparticles](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10855549/authors#authors)" has been published in _IEEE Transactions on Magnetics_! This collaborative effort with Drs. Andrew Wang, Changzhi Li, Jenifer Gomez, and Rui He explores advancements in magnetic hyperthermia therapy.

  

Magnetic hyperthermia therapy is a promising treatment for tumors. In this study, we carefully analyzed temperature-time (T-t) curves and intrinsic loss power (ILP) values of several commercially available iron oxide MNPs. By systematically varying MNP concentration, magnetic core size, and adjusting the frequency and amplitude of the alternating magnetic field (AMF), we aimed to uncover how these factors collectively influence heat dissipation. Our findings provide valuable insights into optimizing conditions for _in vivo_Â hyperthermia treatments.
