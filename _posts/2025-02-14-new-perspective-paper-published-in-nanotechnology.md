Dr. Kai Wu and Dr. Rui He have recently published a Perspective paper titled "[Perspective: Magnetic quantum sensors for biomedical applications](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1361-6528/adb635)" in Nanotechnology. This work aligns with the NIHâ€™s recent Notice of Special Interest (NOSI): Quantum Sensing Technologies in Biomedical Applications (NOT-EB-23-022) and explores the landscape of magnetic quantum sensors from lab research to commercialization.

  

This Perspective reviews key quantum sensing technologies, including SQUID, MRI, OPM, NV magnetometers. Also highlights emerging spintronic devices as the next-generation magnetic quantum sensors for medical imaging and biosensing. While mature MR sensors like GMR and MTJ are already commercialized, cutting-edge technologies such as STOs, SHOs, 2D vdW magnets, and skyrmions remain in the lab stage, facing challenges like environmental sensitivity, limited operational temperatures, and measurement constraints.
