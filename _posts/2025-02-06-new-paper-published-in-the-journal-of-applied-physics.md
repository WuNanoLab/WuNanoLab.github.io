Our recent collaborative work titled "[Study and Optimization on Hyperthermia Performance of Magnetic Fluids Modeled by Coupled Brownian-Néel Rotations](https://pubs.aip.org/aip/jap/article/137/5/054702/3334091/Study-and-optimization-on-hyperthermia-performance?searchresult=1)" is now published in the Journal of Applied Physics.

  

In this work, we applied the stochastic Langevin equation to study superparamagnetic nanoparticle (SMNP) relaxation, considering Brownian–Néel mechanisms and dipole–dipole interactions. Our findings reveal that these interactions suppress relaxation, reducing specific absorption rate (SAR). We also analyzed how particle size, concentration, and anisotropy affect SAR, providing insights for optimizing magnetic field systems and SMNP design.
