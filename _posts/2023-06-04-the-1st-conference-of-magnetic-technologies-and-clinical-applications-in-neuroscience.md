Prof. Wu is serving as the conference committee for the 1st Conference of Magnetic Technologies and Clinical Applications in Neuroscience ([MagCAN Conference](https://neurospin.umn.edu/node/351)). Which will be held on August 24 - August 25, 2023, at the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities.

  

This year's conference will concentrate on the latest developments in magnetic and spintronic devices and systems, with a particular emphasis on their potential applications in neural stimulation and sensing, diagnosis and treatment of neurological disorders, and brain-inspired technologies. The goal is to leverage the knowledge gained from these advances in magnetic and spintronic research and their related principles to develop innovative technologies that mimic the workings of the brain.
