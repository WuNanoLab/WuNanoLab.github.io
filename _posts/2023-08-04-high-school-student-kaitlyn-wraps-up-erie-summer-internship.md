Congratulations to Kaitlyn on successfully completing the TTU ERIE program summer internship in our lab! We were thrilled to have her as part of our team. On August 3rd, she delivered a remarkable final report in Livermore Room 104. Throughout her internship, Kaitlyn made significant contributions to the study of magnetic particle spectroscopy (MPS)-based biosensors. Her dedication and hard work have been truly inspiring.

  

As she moves forward, we extend our best wishes to Kaitlyn for a bright and successful future. We have no doubt that she will continue to excel in her endeavors. Well done, Kaitlyn!
