Our recent work titled "[Magnetic Nanoparticles for Magnetic Particle Imaging (MPI): Design and Applications](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/Content/ArticleLanding/2024/NR/D4NR01195C)" has been published in Nanoscale. MPI is a non-invasive, non-radioactive, tracer-based medical imaging technique that uses biologically safe magnetic nanoparticles. We look forward to sharing more discoveries and research in this exciting field!
