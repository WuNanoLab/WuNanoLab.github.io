Our lab's paper, "[Magnetic Nanoparticles: A Review on Synthesis, Characterization, Functionalization, and Biomedical Applications](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/smll.202304848)," has been recognized as the Top 10% Most Viewed Articles in Small for 2023 — and even more impressively, it’s also one of the Top Cited Papers in the journal!

  

This comprehensive review explores magnetic nanoparticles from the perspectives of materials science, chemistry, and biomedical applications, highlighting their roles in diagnostics and therapy.

  

Congratulations to the first author Bahar Rezaei. Notably, three undergraduate researchers contributed to this work—kudos to Sean Sanders, Haotong Wang, and Kanglin Xu. A big thank you to our collaborators from Drs. Jian-Ping Wang and Jenifer Gomez Pastora's labs—excellent teamwork!
