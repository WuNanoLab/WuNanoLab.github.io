Prof. Wu's European Patent "Magnetic particle spectroscopy method and device" ([EP4136439A1](https://patents.google.com/patent/EP4136439A1/en?oq=EP4136439A1)) is published online today. This patent covers a bioassay system includes at least one conductive excitation coil, the at least one conductive excitation coil configured to generate an alternating magnetic field including a first frequency and a second frequency. The bioassay system further includes a sample mount configured to position a sample within the at least one conductive excitation coil, and at least one sensing conductive coil configured to determine a magnetic response of a sample positioned within the sample mount to the alternating magnetic field.
