Our new paper titled "Micromagnetic stimulation (µMS) dose-response of the rat sciatic nerve" is published in ournal of Neural Engineering.

This work reports that µMS can successfully activate the sciatic nerve in a dose-dependent manner. The MagPen probe, unlike electrodes, does not have a direct electrochemical interface with tissues rendering it much safer than an electrode.
