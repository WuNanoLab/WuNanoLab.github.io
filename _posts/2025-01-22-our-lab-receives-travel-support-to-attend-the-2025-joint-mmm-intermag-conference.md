We are excited to announce that our lab has received travel funding from Texas Tech University to attend the 2025 Joint MMM-Intermag Conference in New Orleans.

  

Ph.D. student Shahriar Mostufa was awarded a $450 Student Travel Fund from the TTU Graduate School, while Prof. Kai Wu received a $1,000 Faculty Conference Travel Grant from the TTU Office of Research & Innovation. These funds will support our lab members in presenting their research through oral and poster presentations at this prestigious conference.

  

We are grateful for this support, which enables us to share our work with the broader scientific community and engage in valuable discussions on magnetic materials and applications.
