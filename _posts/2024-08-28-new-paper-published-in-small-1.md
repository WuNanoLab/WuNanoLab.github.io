Our latest research with collaborators has been published in Small, titled "[An Integrated Micro-Heating System for On-Chip Isothermal Amplification of African Swine Fever Virus Genes](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/smll.202402446)". This work reports the on-chip isothermal amplification of ASFV genes.

  

We developed a novel third-order serpentine micro-heater integrated with a PID control system for on-chip loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP). Our method achieved a detection limit of 8.4 copies/reaction for the B646L gene of the African Swine Fever Virus (ASFV). This micro-heater-based LAMP technique offers a promising solution for the rapid detection of ASFV at a low cost.
