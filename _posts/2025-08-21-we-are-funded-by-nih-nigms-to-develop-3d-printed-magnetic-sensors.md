Our lab has been awarded a four-year, $588,371 research grant from the National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) of the National Institutes of Health under Award Number R16GM158539.

  

This project will advance magnetocardiography (MCG)Â technology by integrating additive-manufactured organic granular magnetoresistive (OgMR) sensorsÂ with machine learningÂ for next-generation cardiac diagnostics. Unlike conventional thin-film deposition and micro/nano-fabrication approaches, OgMR sensors embed magnetic nanoparticles into organic semiconductors, enabling direct printing on flexible substrates at high volume and low cost. Our preliminary results show that OgMR sensors achieve 50Ã— higher magnetoresistance than GMR sensorsÂ and performance comparable to MTJs, positioning them as a transformative platform for low-cost, flexible, and highly sensitive magnetic sensorsÂ for cardiac signal recording.

  

This collaborative effort is supported by Dr. Minxiang ZengÂ at Texas Tech University.
