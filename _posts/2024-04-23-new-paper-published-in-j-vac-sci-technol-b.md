Our collaborative work with the University of Minnesota, titled "[Planar Microcoil Arrays for In Vitro Cellular-Level Micromagnetic Activation of Neurons](https://pubs.aip.org/avs/jvb/article/42/3/033001/3284521/Planar-microcoil-arrays-for-in-vitro-cellular)," has been published in the Journal of Vacuum Science and Technology B. In this study, we present the design and fabrication of planar microcoil arrays, referred to as Magnetic Patch (MagPatch), for activating single neurons. Utilizing numerical calculations conducted on ANSYS-Maxwell and NEURON, we report an optimized MagPatch array design that leverages the directionality of the induced electric field from the microcoils to enhance spatial selectivity.
