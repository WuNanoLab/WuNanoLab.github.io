Our collaborative work, titled "[Origin of Large Effective Phonon Magnetic Moments in Monolayer MoS2](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acsnano.4c18906)" is now published online in ACS Nano!

This work, led by Drs. Rui He (Texas Tech University) and Wencan Jin (Auburn University), reported the origin of large phonon magnetic moments observed in magneto-Raman spectroscopy of monolayer MoS2.

  

Our study demonstrates that the orbital-phonon coupling model, previously applied to paramagnets and magnets, can be extended to monolayer MoSâ‚‚. This establishes exciton transitions in spin-valley coupled transition metal dichalcogenides as a new mechanism for activating giant effective phonon magnetic moments in nonmagnetic materials.
