Our new paper titled "Theoretical Investigation on the Metamaterials Based on the Magnetic Template-Assisted Self-Assembly of Magneticâ€“Plasmonic Nanoparticles for Adjustable Photonic Responses" is published in the Journal of Physical Chemistry B.

  

In this paper, we present an innovative microfluidic and magnetic template-assisted self-assembly technique. This method primarily leverages the magnetic dipole-dipole interactions among magnetized magnetic-plasmonic nanoparticles, coupled with the mechanical constraints imposed by specially designed traps. Notably, this groundbreaking approach eliminates the need for specific chemical processes and offers precise magnetophoretic control over the assembly of magnetic-plasmonic nanoparticles. This advancement empowers us to craft asymmetric colloidal molecules using a bottom-up approach, opening up new avenues for the creation of unique microscale structures. These structures have significant potential applications in fields such as biosensing, patterning, and targeted delivery.
