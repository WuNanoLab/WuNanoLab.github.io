Prof. Wu was recently recognized as one of Texas Techâ€™s Most Influential Faculty Members. Each semester, graduating seniors with a GPA of 3.5 or higher are invited to nominate a faculty or staff member who made a significant impact on their academic journey. Prof. Wu was nominated by graduating senior Robert Sherrick.

  

Kudos to Robert on his outstanding academic achievement, and congratulations to Prof. Wu on this well-deserved recognition!
