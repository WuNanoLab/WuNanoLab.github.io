Our recent work titled "[Numerical Analysis of Hybrid Electromagnetic Coil Designs for Efficient Gradient Field Generation in Magnetic Particle Imaging](https://pubs.aip.org/aip/adv/article/15/3/035217/3339502/Numerical-analysis-of-hybrid-electromagnetic-coil)" is published in AIP Advances!

  

This work optimized electromagnetic coil designs for more efficient gradient field generation in Magnetic Particle Imaging (MPI). Using COMSOL Multiphysics, we conducted a numerical study comparing three distinct coil configurations to enhance field uniformity while minimizing power consumption. We explored: Maxwell Electromagnetic (EM) Coils, Hybrid EM Coils with an NdFeB Magnet Core, and Hybrid EM Coils with an NdFeB Core Designed as a Magnetic Flux Concentrator (MFC). Our findings reveal that integrating an NdFeB core with an MFC design significantly boosts gradient field strengthâ€”achieving 5 T/m, compared to 2.3 T/m from standard EM coils and 4.4 T/m from hybrid EM coils with an NdFeB core.
