The club has 9 participating faculty members and 12 PhD student presenters. The main objective of the club is to encourage PhD students to read research papers, improve their academic presentation skills, and broaden their horizons on biosensors, biomedical equipment, and related technologies. Additionally, the club provides an opportunity for faculty members to find potential collaborations and new research ideas.

Looking forward to 2023 Fall BioMed Journal Club!
