A collaborative work titled "[Ultrasensitive Terahertz Metamaterial Sensor Based on Planar Metal-Insulator-Metal Structure](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10804054)" is published in the IEEE Sensors Journal, in collaboration with Dr. Jiajia Sun's lab.

  

In this work, we present a novel THz metamaterial sensor for label-free, nondestructive protein probing. Unlike conventional sensors, where analytes are absorbed onto the surface and hot spots are confined within an insulating layer (limiting sensitivity), our design introduces a planar metal-insulator-metal (p-MIM) structure with a 1 Âµm air gap between two metal stripes. This unique configuration generates highly localized enhanced fields within the air gap, enabling direct interaction with the analyte. We experimentally demonstrated the sensor's enhanced performance by detecting photoresist and bovine serum albumin (BSA).

  

This work opens doors to further innovations in biosensing technologies. Check it out!
