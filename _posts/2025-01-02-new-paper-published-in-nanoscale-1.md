We are excited to introduce the recent publication in Nanoscale, titled ‘[Printing rare-earth-free (REF) magnetic inks: synthesis, formulation, and device applications](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2025/nr/d4nr04035j).’ In collaboration with Drs. Mortaza Saeidi-Javash, Jenifer Gómez-Pastora, and  Minxiang Zeng.

  

This review highlights recent advancements in additive manufacturing (AM) of rare-earth-free (REF) magnetic materials, offering cost-effective and sustainable alternatives to rare-earth-element (REE) magnets. REF materials, including spinel ferrites, hexaferrites, MnAl, MnBi, Alnico, FePt, and iron oxides/nitrides, show promise for high-performance magnetic device fabrication. The review covers synthesis strategies, magnetic ink formulation, and integration into AM techniques such as direct ink writing, inkjet printing, aerosol jet printing, and screen printing. It emphasizes the structure-processing-property relationships in REF magnetic inks and discusses challenges and opportunities in developing scalable, cost-efficient, and high-performance printable magnetic systems.
