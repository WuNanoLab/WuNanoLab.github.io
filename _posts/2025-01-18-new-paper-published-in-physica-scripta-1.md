We are excited to announce our recent publication in Physica Scripta, a collaborative effort with Drs. Andrew Wang, Jian-Ping Wang, Changzhi Li, Jennifer Gomez, and Rui He. Titled "[Effect of Tracer Size Distribution on Magnetic Particle Imaging Performance](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1402-4896/adab46)". We thank the support provided by Ocean NanoTech, LLC.

  

In this study, we explored a critical aspect of Magnetic Particle Imaging (MPI) systems: the size uniformity of the magnetic nanoparticle (MNP) tracer. Traditionally, models and experiments assume that all tracers are of uniform size. However, this assumption overlooks a key reality: the size of MNP tracers follows a lognormal distribution. Our research addresses this gap by evaluating the impact of MNP tracer size distribution on MPI applications. We employed a stochastic Langevin function coupled with Brownian-NÃ©el relaxation models to simulate the dynamic magnetization responses of MNP tracers. Using experimentally observed sizes and distributions, we varied the size uniformity to investigate how tracers with identical average sizes but different size distributions influence MPI signal strength and imaging resolution.
