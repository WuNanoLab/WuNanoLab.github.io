We are thrilled to have showcased our research at this year’s Whitacre College of Engineering (WCOE) Research Day. Dr. Kai Wu delivered a talk on “Magnetic Nanomaterials and Nanodevices for Biomedical Applications.” Shahriar Mostufa presented his poster, “Numerical Analysis of Hybrid Electromagnetic Coil Designs for Efficient Gradient Field Generation in Magnetic Particle Imaging.” Bahareh Rezaei presented her poster, “Investigation on the Magnetic Hyperthermia Performance of Commercial Iron Oxide Magnetic Nanoparticles.” Congratulations to all our presenters for their contributions!

  

In addition, Bahareh has been awarded the most popular poster presentation award!
