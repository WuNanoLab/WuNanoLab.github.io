We are thrilled to announce the winners of the Spring 2025 BioMed Journal Club Best Presentation Awards!

  

**First Place: Md Shahriar**

**Second Place: Andrew M. Evans, Bahareh Rezaei**

**Third Place: Hashem Saker, Nguyen Thuy Linh Tran, Arjun Sharma**

  

The BioMed Journal Club began in Spring 2023, and we’ve now completed five successful seasons. Each semester, 10–12 Ph.D. students from the College of Engineering present research papers, fostering critical reading, sharpening academic presentation skills, and expanding exposure to a wide range of biomedical topics. This initiative not only benefits students but also helps faculties discover new collaboration opportunities and research directions.

  

A heartfelt thank you to all the participating students and faculties, and special thanks to Dr. Changzhi Li, the Edward E. Whitacre, Jr. College of Engineering, and the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Texas Tech University for their continued support.
