We are excited to announce a new institutional focus collection on Texas Tech University (TTU), in collaboration with _Nanotechnology_Â (IOP Publishing)! Initiated by Drs. Kai Wu, Rui He, Hieu P. Nguyen, Yun Suk Eo, and Minxiang Zengâ€”who are serving as guest editorsâ€”this special issue highlights the vibrant and interdisciplinary nanotechnology research taking place at TTU. From advanced materials and biomedical innovations to quantum science and next-generation electronics, TTU researchers are pushing the frontiers of science and technology.
