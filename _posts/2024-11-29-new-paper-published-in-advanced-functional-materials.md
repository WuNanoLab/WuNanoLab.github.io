We are excited to announce that our review article, "[Additive Manufacturing of Magnetic Materials for Energy, Environment, Healthcare, and Industry Applications](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/adfm.202416823)," has been published in Advanced Functional Materials! This collaborative work, conducted with Drs. Xiaolong Liu, Minxiang Zeng, Jenifer GÃ³mez-Pastora, and Rui He, highlight the transformative potential of additive manufacturing (AM) in magnetic materials research.

  

The article introduces several ink-based and ink-free AM processes, showcasing their applications in fabricating innovative magnetic materials and devices. Examples include energy harvesting systems, self-propelled microswimmers for water treatment, drug delivery platforms, biocompatible microrobots, magnetic actuators, sensors, and bulk rare-earth-free magnets.

  

We hope this work inspires new advancements at the intersection of AM and magnetics!
