Our new paper titled "[Static and Dynamic Magnetization Responses of Self-Assembled Magnetic Nanoparticle Chains](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jpcc.3c03755)" is published in the Journal of Physical Chemistry C.

  

The utilization of dynamic magnetization reactions in magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) exposed to alternating magnetic fields has found application in various biomedical fields, including hyperthermia therapy, magnetic biosensing, and imaging. Understanding how different factors influence these dynamic magnetization responses can be difficult due to the intricate energy terms and interparticle interactions involved. In this study, we conducted a systematic investigation into the static and dynamic magnetization responses of both MNPs and their extended chains.
