Our collaborative work with Drs. Bing Lv, Jia-An Yan, Paul M. Shand, Andrew Stollenwerk, and Rui He, titled "[Tuning the Magnetic Properties of CrI3 Using Ni Thin Film Deposition for Applications in Spintronic Devices](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acsanm.4c06641)" is published in ACS Applied Nano Materials.

  

In this work, we demonstrate that the magnetic state of CrI₃ can be tuned by depositing a thin metal layer, offering a new strategy for controlling spin degrees of freedom in van der Waals magnets. Using electron-beam evaporation, we deposited a 4 nm Ni layer on bulk CrI₃, forming a Ni/CrI₃ heterostructure. Ultralow-frequency magneto-Raman spectroscopy revealed a transition from antiferromagnetic (AFM) surface layers in pristine CrI₃ to a fully ferromagnetic (FM) state after Ni deposition. This approach not only enables magnetic phase tuning but also protects CrI₃ from rapid air degradation—both crucial for its potential applications in spintronic devices and magnetic sensors.
