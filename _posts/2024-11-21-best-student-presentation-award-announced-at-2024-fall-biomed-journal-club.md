The 2024 Fall [BioMed Journal Club](https://www.wunanolab.com/services-6)Â is a weekly event hosted by the TTU ECE Department every Wednesday from September 11th to November 20th, 2024. The main objective of the club is to encourage PhD students to read research papers, improve their academic presentation skills, and broaden their horizons on biosensors, biomedical equipment, and related technologies. Additionally, the club provides an opportunity for faculty members to find potential collaborations and new research ideas.

  

Looking forward to the 2025 Spring BioMed Journal Club!
