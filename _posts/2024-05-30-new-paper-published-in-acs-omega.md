Our recent work titled "[Advancements and Perspectives in Optical Biosensors](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsomega.4c01872)" has been published in ACS Omega.

  

This comprehensive review covers various optical biosensors, including whispering gallery mode biosensors, 2D photonic crystal array (nanocavity) biosensors, nanoplasmonic biosensors, and metasurface-based biosensors. We discuss their structural designs, sensing principles, the physics underlying their mechanisms, applications, current research progress, and their roles in detecting diverse biomaterials.
