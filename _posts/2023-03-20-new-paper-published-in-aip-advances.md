Our new paper titled "[Magnetic field detection using spin-torque nano-oscillator combined with magnetic flux concentrator](https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/9.0000597)" is published AIP Advances.

This paper studied the spin-torque nano-oscillators (STNO) governed by the LLG equation. The STNO can be applied as an ultra-sensitive magnetic field sensor. The GHz precessional frequency of magnetization in free layer can be shifted by a weak external magnetic field. Which allows for field detection. Combined with a pair of magnetic flux concentrator (MFC), the detection limit of STNO can be further improved.
