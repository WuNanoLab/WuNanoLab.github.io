Our new paper titled "[Giant Magnetoresistance Based Biosensors for Cancer Screening and Detection](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acsabm.3c00592)" is published in ACS Applied Bio Materials.

In this work, we start by introducing three types of GMR biosensors, discussing their structures and underlying principles, followed by an examination of fabrication techniques. To enable the detection of specific cancer biomarkers, we explore methods for surface functionalization. We also highlight the global research demonstrating the reliability of GMR-based biosensors in cancer detection, provide examples, and conclude with a discussion on the challenges and future prospects of GMR biosensor platforms. It is evident that GMR biosensor platforms hold significant promise and are poised to evolve into dependable products for cancer screening in the near future.
