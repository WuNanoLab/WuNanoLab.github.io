We are excited to receive a Summer Alternative Energy Seed Fund from the Whitacre College of Engineering. This support kickstarts our project on "Magnetically Reconfigurable Photothermal Surfaces for Adaptive Solar Steam Generation and Waste Heat Energy Harvesting". Our design enables localized evaporation control, antifouling reset mechanisms, and solar angle adaptationâ€”all without using electrical power. This power-free and low-maintenance system is engineered for continuous, off-grid operation, offering a sustainable solution for co-generating clean water and electricity.

  

The project holds transformative potential for disaster relief zones, remote communities, and developing regions, and aligns with global efforts toward clean energy, water security, and climate resilience.
