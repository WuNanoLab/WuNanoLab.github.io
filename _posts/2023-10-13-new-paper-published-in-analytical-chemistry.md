Our new paper titled "[Nanomaterial-Based Biosensors for SARS-CoV-2 and Future Epidemics](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.analchem.3c01522)" is published in Analytical Chemistry.

  

The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by SARS-CoV-2, has had a profound impact globally. Previous epidemics like SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV raised awareness about the need for rapid virus control. However, limited diagnostics, test kit production challenges, and complex procedures have hindered COVID-19 control. This review focuses on advancements in nanotechnology-based biosensors for SARS-CoV-2 detection, covering molecular, antigen, and antibody tests. We discuss their pros and cons to address future epidemic challenges.
