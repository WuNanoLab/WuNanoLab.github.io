This year, our group is delighted to welcome two exceptional high school students, **Kaitlyn Villarreal** from Friendship High School in Lubbock, TX, and **Sahil Hora** from Heritage High School in Dallas, TX, as summer interns!

Kaitlyn secured her place in our lab through the TTU Engineering Research Internship Experience (ERIE) Program. During her internship, she will be actively involved in the development of magnetic particle spectroscopy (MPS)-based biosensors. Her contributions will help advance our understanding of this innovative technology.

Sahil, on the other hand, will be focusing on machine learning assisted healthcare, specifically in the area of cardiac rhythm diagnosis. His work will contribute to the development of cutting-edge methods that utilize machine learning algorithms to enhance healthcare practices.

At our lab, we always look forward to welcoming high school students and involving them in research projects that explore the fascinating world of nanomaterials and healthcare. We place great value on diversity and are dedicated to nurturing and educating the next generation of scientists.
