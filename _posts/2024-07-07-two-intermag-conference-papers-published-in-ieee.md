Two INTERMAG 2024 conference papers are online! Both are invited talks at the conference, the results are from Prof. Wu's previous lab at UMN!

1\. (DD-07) [Magnetic Particle Spectroscopy (MPS)-Based Bioassays](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10577056)

We provided an overview of the magnetic particle spectroscopy (MPS) technique and the team's new findings, including the 5-minute assay and the multiplexed assay work.

  

2\. (BA-04) [Micromagnetic Neural Stimulation and Spintronic Neural Sensing](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10576875)

We reported new findings on magnetic microdevices and spintronic devices for neurostimulation and neuron signal recording.
