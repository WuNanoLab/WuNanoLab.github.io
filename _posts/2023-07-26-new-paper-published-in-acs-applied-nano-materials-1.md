Our new paper titled "[Flexible Magnetic Field Nanosensors for Wearable Electronics: A Review](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsanm.3c01936)" is published in ACS Applied Nano Materials.

  

In this review, we present an overview of recent progress in the realm of flexible magnetic field nanosensors. The focus is on several types of sensors, including flexible Hall sensors, flexible magnetoresistive (MR) sensors like giant magnetoresistance (GMR), magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ), and anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR) sensors, flexible fluxgate sensors, and flexible giant magnetoimpedance (GMI) sensors. For each sensor type, we delve into various fabrication methods and explore their real-life applications. Additionally, we address the technical challenges that these sensors encounter.

  

The utilization of these flexible nanosensors paves the way for expanded possibilities in human-computer interaction and holds promising potential for wearable technology across diverse domains. With their inherent robustness and the ongoing trend to minimize energy consumption, these sensors are set to remain focal points for further research.
