We have been awarded a $157,184 grant from the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB) of the National Institutes of Health under Award Number [R03EB036435](https://reporter.nih.gov/search/JbRgAtchAUKHOoW2X1vObQ/projects/map/project-details/11217212).

  

This 2-year project aims to develop a multi-tracer Magnetic Particle Imaging (MMPI) system capable of simultaneously imaging multiple biological processes. The approach includes separating signals from different magnetic nanoparticle (MNP) tracers into distinct spectral channels, reconstructing individual tracer images, and integrating them into a single, comprehensive MMPI image. To enhance MMPI performance, the team will optimize MNP tracers for improved spectral separation, reduced channel leakage, and increased biocompatibility. These advances will be validated using custom-designed 3D-printed phantoms as a proof of concept.

  

This work is supported by collaborative contributions from Drs. Minxiang Zeng and Jenifer Gomez Pastora at Texas Tech University and Dr. Solomon Woods at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).
