Our new paper titled "[Static and Dynamic Magnetization Models of Magnetic Nanoparticles: An Appraisal](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1402-4896/ace8d1)" is published in Physica Scripta.

This work summarized several popular mathematical models that have been used to describe, explain, and predict the static and dynamic magnetization responses of MNPs.
