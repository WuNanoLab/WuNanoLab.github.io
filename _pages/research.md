## Magnetic Nanoparticles for Biomedical Applications

Magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) are versatile tools with wide-ranging biomedical uses, including magnetogenetics, biosensing, targeted drug delivery, hyperthermia therapy, and imaging. Research in this area focuses on engineering MNPs with enhanced magnetic properties, surface functionalization for biocompatibility and targeting, and comprehensive performance characterization. By tailoring their properties for stronger responses and finer control, MNPs are being advanced into next-generation platforms for precision diagnostics and effective, noninvasive therapies.

## Magnetic Particle Imaging for Precision Diagnostics

Magnetic particle imaging (MPI) is a non-invasive technique that directly detects nanoparticle tracers, producing high-contrast, real-time maps of their distribution in the body. Unlike MRI, MPI has no tissue background signal, allowing highly sensitive and quantitative imaging of blood flow, organ function, inflammation, and tumors. Its rapid imaging speed, safety, and potential for human-scale translation position MPI as a powerful tool for precision medicine and theranostics, with applications ranging from early disease detection to monitoring drug delivery in real time.

## Magnetic Microdevices for Next-Generation Neurostimulation

This research explores magnetic microdevices as an alternative to traditional electrical implants for neural stimulation. These devices generate localized, time-varying magnetic fields that induce electric fields in nearby neurons, enabling micrometer-scale, spatially confined activation without direct tissue contact. This approach combines the precision of implantable devices with the noninvasive benefits of transcranial magnetic stimulation, potentially reducing risks of inflammation, biofouling, and surgical revisions. The long-term impact includes safer, more effective therapies for neurological disorders such as epilepsy, Parkinson's disease, and chronic pain.
